select a.name,a.grade,b.name,b.grade,c.name,c.grade
from highschooler a,highschooler b,highschooler c,likes d
where a.id = d.id1 and b.id = d.id2 
and c.id in (select e.id2 from likes e where e.id1=b.id)
and a.id not in (select e.id2 from likes e where e.id1=b.id);

Q2
Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades.

where not exists
(select * from highschooler b,friend c
where c.id1 = a.id and c.id2 = b.id and b.grade = a.grade);

(select count(id2) as cnt
from friend
group by id1);

Q4
Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend. 

select count(*)-1 from
(select name,grade
from highschooler

or id in (select id2 from friend where id1 in (select id2 from friend where id1=(select id from highschooler where name = 'Cassandra'))));

Q5
Find the name and grade of the student(s) with the greatest number of friends. 

select name,grade
from highschooler
where id in
(select id1
from (select id1,count(id2) as cnt from friend group by id1)
where cnt = (select max(cnt) from (select id1,count(id2) as cnt from friend group by id1)));

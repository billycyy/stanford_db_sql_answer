Q1
It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler. 

delete from highschooler
where grade = 12;

Q2
If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple.

delete from likes 
where id1 in 
(select a.id1 from likes a
where a.id2 in (select b.id2 from friend b where b.id1 = a.id1)
and a.id2 not in (select c.id1 from likes c where c.id2 = a.id1)
);

Q3
For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. (This one is a bit challenging; congratulations if you get it right.) 

insert into friend
select a.id1,b.id2 from
friend a, friend b
where a.id1 != b.id2
and a.id2 = b.id1
except
select id1,id2 from friend;
